      { q: "Are there regular techno nights in Bangalore?", a: "Yes — there's a recurring rhythm of techno nights in Indiranagar, CBD, and east Bengaluru, anchored by independent crews. Most are 200-400 capacity and free with RSVP." },
      { q: "What time do techno parties in Bengaluru run?", a: "Doors usually 9pm, peak between 12am and 2am. Bengaluru's licensing means most nights wrap by 1-2am unless it's a private warehouse event." },
