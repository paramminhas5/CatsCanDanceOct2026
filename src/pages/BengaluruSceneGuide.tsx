          Bengaluru's underground dance music scene is one of India's most active, built around House,
          Techno, Disco, Jungle, Garage, and Drum & Bass. Independent collectives like Cats Can Dance
          host regular RSVP-only episodes at intimate venues across the city — distinct from mainstream
          nightlife, built entirely on community and sound.
        </p>
        <p className="text-ink/75 text-lg font-medium mb-4">
          Unlike mainstream clubs playing commercial EDM or Bollywood, Bengaluru's underground scene is
          genre-specific, selector-led, and community-driven. It emerged from a small group of DJs,
          collectors, and dancers who wanted events focused entirely on the music.
        </p>
        <p className="text-ink/75 text-lg font-medium">
          The scene covers several distinct subgenres, each with its own following in the city:

          <p>
            Cats Can Dance (CCD) is a Bengaluru-based underground dance music event series and streetwear
            collective. Founded as a celebration of dance music, cat culture, and the people who keep it
            alive, CCD hosts regular RSVP-only episodes at Bar Wild and other Bengaluru venues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every episode is a curated selector lineup — no commercial breaks, no mainstream drops.
            The music policy covers House, Disco, Jungle, Garage, and Drum & Bass. Resident selectors
            include Djazz, Hedz, and Sartdawg, with regular guest appearances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond events, Cats Can Dance produces limited-edition streetwear drops rooted in dance music
            culture — one of the few collectives in India operating at the intersection of music, fashion,
            and community.
